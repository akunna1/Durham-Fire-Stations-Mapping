# Durham Fire Stations Mapping

This project visualizes **Durham Fire Stations** by battalion on a map using R. The map is generated from a CSV file containing station names, battalion numbers, and physical addresses. Each station is geocoded to latitude and longitude, and battalion areas are highlighted with convex hulls for clarity.

## 📝 CSV Format

The CSV file `addresses_to_geocode.csv` should have the following columns:

| Station   | Battalion | Physical Location                     |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Station 1 | 1         | 139 E. Morgan Street Durham, NC 27701 |
| Station 2 | 1         | 1001 Ninth Street Durham, NC 27705    |
| ...       | ...       | ...                                   |

## 🎨 Map Features

* **County Boundary:** Shows Durham County.
* **Fire Stations:** Points colored by battalion.
* **Battalion Areas:** Highlighted using convex hulls.
* **Station Labels:** Short form (`S1, S2…`) for clarity.
* **Presentation-Ready Theme:** Clean background, subtle grid, and professional styling.

---

## ⚡ Notes

* Some addresses may fail to geocode. Check the console for `NA` coordinates and update the addresses as needed.
* OpenStreetMap (via `tidygeocoder`) is used for geocoding. You can switch to `method = "arcgis"` if preferred.
