Durham Fire Stations Mapping

This project visualizes Durham Fire Stations by battalion on a map using R. The map is generated from a CSV file containing station names, battalion numbers, and physical addresses. Each station is geocoded to latitude and longitude, and battalion areas are highlighted with convex hulls for clarity.

Project Structure:

* addresses_to_geocode.csv  : CSV file with station names, battalion, and addresses
* Durham_Fire_Stations_Map.png  : Output map generated by the R script
* fire_stations_mapping.R  : Main R script
* README.txt  : Project documentation

Requirements:

* R version 4.5.0 or higher
* R packages: tidygeocoder, dplyr, sf, ggplot2, tigris, ggrepel
  Install them using:
  install.packages(c("tidygeocoder", "dplyr", "sf", "ggplot2", "tigris", "ggrepel"))

CSV Format:

The CSV file `addresses_to_geocode.csv` should have the following columns:

Station | Battalion | Physical Location
Station 1 | 1 | 139 E. Morgan Street Durham, NC 27701
Station 2 | 1 | 1001 Ninth Street Durham, NC 27705
... | ... | ...

How to Run:

1. Clone the repository and set your working directory to the project folder.
2. Open R or RStudio.
3. Run the script: source("fire_stations_mapping.R")
4. The map will be saved as Durham_Fire_Stations_Map.png in the project folder.

Map Features:

* County Boundary: Shows Durham County
* Fire Stations: Points colored by battalion
* Battalion Areas: Highlighted using convex hulls
* Station Labels: Short form (S1, S2, …) for clarity
* Presentation-Ready Theme: Clean background, subtle grid, and professional styling

Notes:

* Some addresses may fail to geocode. Check the console for NA coordinates and update the addresses if needed.
* OpenStreetMap (via tidygeocoder) is used for geocoding. You can switch to method = "arcgis" if preferred.
